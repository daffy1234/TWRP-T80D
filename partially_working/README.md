# Partially Working
When the tablet has android 6 installed, this version of TWRP maxes the screen brightness, nothing displays on the screen, and ADB starts up. You can communicate with TWRP for a little bit through ADB before it dies. This is enough to flash SuperSU, but only on the android 6 version.  

When the tablet has android 8 installed, the loading screen loops forever.
